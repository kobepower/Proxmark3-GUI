## 💡 Pro Tips

### ✅ Always Verify
After every clone, run **Search** again to confirm it worked.

### ✅ Backup First
Before experimenting, click **💾 T55xx Dump** to save original data.

### ✅ Wipe Before Indala
Indala clones work best when you **🔓 T55xx Wipe** first.

### ✅ Read the Output
The colorized console shows:
- 🟢 **Green** = Success
- 🔴 **Red** = Error
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Warning
- 🔵 **Cyan** = Data/Info

### ✅ Try LF First
Most building access cards are LF (125kHz). Try **LF Search** before HF.

### ✅ Use Autopwn for MIFARE
Don't manually try keys - **🤖 MIFARE Autopwn** does it all automatically.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No tag found"
- Check card placement on antenna
- Try rotating card 90 degrees
- Ensure PM3 is connected (green status indicator)

### "Clone failed"
- Ensure blank card is T55xx type
- Try **🔓 T55xx Wipe** first
- For Indala: try all 3 clone methods

### "Autopwn failed"
- Card may have custom keys
- Try **🔓 Nested Attack** instead
- Some cards are encrypted and can't be cloned

### "Command returns 0 chars"
- PM3 may be disconnected
- Click **🔌 Connect** again
- Check logs at bottom of window
